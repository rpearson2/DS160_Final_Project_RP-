# DS160_Final_Project_RP-
This project aims to study the relationship between a customerâ€™s satisfaction of their flight and the variables that could influence these results. By using logistic regression, the project seeks to provide an accurate model that airline companies could use to predict if a customer will be satisfied or dissatisfied with the service they provide. It will use a wide range of variables that the consumer has input to create models using all or a number of these variables. From this, airlines can use the model to gain valuable insight into what drives customer satisfaction and adjust their service accordingly.
